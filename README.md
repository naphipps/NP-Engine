# NP-Engine

This game engine started out as my first commercially available video game (_Project Rigel_), but the project kept growing, and development ended up splitting into a game engine and a video game. So, here's my game engine code, as I'll keep my video game stuff private :) I've lists a few links below for any curiosities! Let me know if you have any comments, questions, or concerns by creating an issue.

**LICENSE:**

I will get a more-modern licensing setup soon, but for now this will do. All this code is free for you to use in any shape, form, or fashion (regardless of what the comments say in each file). If you use/reference _NP-Engine_ in any shape, form, or fashion, then list _NP-Engine_ as an influence on your project. This code is released AS IS.
