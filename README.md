# NP-Engine

This game engine started out as my first commercially available video game (_Project Rigel_), but the project kept growing, and development ended up splitting into a game engine and a video game. So, here's my game engine code, as I'll keep my video game stuff private :) I've lists a few links below for any curiosities! Let me know if you have any comments, questions, or concerns by creating an issue.
